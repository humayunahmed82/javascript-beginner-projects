# 4 Javascript Beginning Project's

The following are four fundamental JavaScript projects that explore various concepts such as Guess My Number, Drag & Drop, Pig Game, and Price range slider. These projects are specifically tailored to assist seasoned developers in mastering various aspects of JavaScript programming.


## 1. Guess My Number

Creating a "Guess My Number" game can be a fun and easy project for beginners learning JavaScript. I'd be happy to share a simple implementation of the game with you.

## 2. Drag & Drop

## 3. Pig Game

Have you ever heard of the Pig Game? It's a fun two-player dice game that you can play using JavaScript. The objective of the game is to reach a specific score (usually 100) by rolling dice and earning points. But, be careful! If you roll a 1, you lose all your current points and it becomes the other player's turn. So, it's a game of chance that requires both strategy and luck.

## 4. Price range slider

Creating a price range slider using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript allows users to select a price range within a specified minimum and maximum value. Here's how you can implement a simple price range slider.
